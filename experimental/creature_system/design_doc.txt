top down maze crawler dungeon similar to pac man (not grid based, physics based)
difficulty scales as time goes on
dark, dreamlike, dungeoncore aesthetic
creatures in the dungeon are chaotic neutral; they can and will attack each other, not just you
micro gameplay (time-to-reward short):
	collect fruits and dots to gain experience
	defeat enemies to have a chance to gain their powers through dropped items
	perform combos to gain experience faster
	enough experience gained and an event/quest will begin
	finish the quest to end the phase and gain strength

the map will be divided into 3x3 zones and in the middle of each zone will be a structure
reality waves will occasionally pass through the dungeon, regenerating terrain and other structures
not everything has to be serious! have some wacky silly content in there as well

OVERARCHING STORY/MOTIVE (time-to-reward long):
	zones on the map will be in the same location every time you play the game, but the environment around the structures in the center of each zone will be different
	procedural campaign, emergent endgames
	a narrative story told with minimal dialogue
	

exploration, experimentation, combat, strategy, chaos
property alchemy

meta currency
adopting enemy weapons as your own
better terrain look; dark/neon arcade dungeon aesthetic
unlock and play as creatures can find in the game
terrain/walls can be regenerated after a wave, cool falling animation
give player a pick up and throw ability and a shove ability
pickups should not be automatically consumed if walked over, they have to be picked up and and eaten (yes even powerups)
creatures will have two equipment slots for passive items which change aspects of the game (no interface for this, just pick them up and eat the items. if you are full and another item is eaten, the last item you ate is dropped on the ground).
combos for eating fruit consecutively
combos for destroying enemies consecutively (?)
big sound effects and particles when doing combos

WAVE QUESTS
maybe it would be best to restrict the play area during certain quest phases just so the player doesn't get lost or move away from the quest
lock the camera and prevent the player from moving past the camera viewport
or overlay an arrow onto the hud to direct the player to the right location? this seems like a lazy solution which doesn't fit with the dreamlike aesthetic or the theme of unguided exploration of the game

LIST OF QUESTS
carry and break into a loot vault
monoliths
water plants to create a bridge
mining for ore
disrupt a song moth conga before it rallies a horde
harvest meat from a flesh wall
feed a glub gob until it bursts/collapses into a black holle
feed and raise some kori hatchlings
survive a kori invasion/bug horde
unlock a fortress
raise the dead
solve a puzzle
defeat a boss
get 3 different mutations at the same time
escort a magnet mite to a gate to a secret new zone
pacify a rage beast
drill a water well
craft a trap (inworld crafting, no ui)
close a wormhole
survive a rubble landslide which takes you to a different part of the map
airship bombardment

[OVERVIEW]
top-down physics based maze dungeon crawler with emergent gameplay elements
navigate a forever changing labyrinth while surviving waves of wild animals with special powers
assimilate and mix enemy traits like alchemical ingredients, creating new ways to fight back against the ever-changing dream dungeon
unravel an ancient mystery by navigating a web of dreams
microloop:
	explore zones, 
	collect resources, 
	adopt enemy properties, 
	trigger combos, 
	and complete wave quests for rewards
macroloop:
	build meta-progression across runs toward different procedural endgames
PILLARS:
	EXPLORE, EXPERIMENT, FIGHT, STRATEGIZE, CHAOS
(risky structures/loot)
(property alchemy via assimilation)
(enemy interactions / player manipulation)
(trippy visual aesthetic, chaotic scenarios via emergence)
collect meta currency to unlock upgrades/modifiers which will persist between runs

[AESTHETIC AND ATMOSPHERE]
dark neon arcade dreamlike dungeoncore
low resolution sound effects
pulsing synth during combat and low fidelity dungeoncore when roaming
balance between hazy environmental visuals and clarity for dangerous elements
each zone will have a different design, theme, and tileset
	flowers
	sky
	china
	volcano
	lizards
	sewer
	factory
	wind
	techno
	sand
	coral
	winter
	paradise
	woods
	mountain

[CORE MECHANICS]
twin stick shooter
base player kit:
	basic sword
	pick up / throw
	shove
dungeon layout is a large grid of 3x3 zones featuring different environmental features, puzzles, and creatures
zones will be in the same spot on the map every run, allowing for familiar play and competency during meta-quests
the center of zones will always be the same featuring the same landmark, but the dungeon around the landmark is everchanging
certain walls are destructible by creature powers and bombs and will be regenerated by periodic dream waves permeating the dungeon
most creatures are chaotic neutral; creatures are not on a team against the player, they operate based on their own goals
creatures can and will fight each other if they get in each others' way
creatures, terrain, and receptacles can drop pickups which are dropped on the ground
pickups can have a wide range of effects but must be picked up and eaten by creatures before their effect is applied
pickups can be combined together to create more niche or more powerful items
defeat creatures and sometimes they will drop shards (a certain type of pickup) that you can eat to assimilate creature abilities into your own arsenal of abilities; these abilities only last for a small amount of time, so use them wisely
additionally, all creatures possess two slots for passive aspects which alter properties and gameplay
explore the dungeon and collect dots to gain essence and to unlock the next event
when enough essence has been collected, a quest begins based on one of the five pillars (explore, experiment, fight, strategy, chaos)

[PROGRESSION AND REWARDS]
micro (phase-based, short time-to-reward):
	collect dots and pickups for essence (combos for consecutive collection and creative creature kills)
	defeat enemies for property shards (assimilate by eating and mix for synergies)
	enough essence and a quest will trigger (complete to end phase, gain strength via buffs)
macro (run/meta, long time-to-reward):
	scaling difficulty: waves escalate creature density/properties
	zones can link together via quests or portals
	after 5-7 phases, a major quest will be triggered as a climactic event
	meta currency buys unlocks (unlock more creatures, environment types, pickups, quest packs)
gain more essence faster by doing combos
	collecting and eating fruit in quick succession
	defeating creatures in creative ways
unlock playable creatures
overarching movive and story to get the player to keep playing long-term
environmental storytelling through landmarks and unlocking new environments
minimal monologue/dialogue

[WAVE QUESTS]
quests are triggered after gaining enough essence during a roaming phase
quests might be completely different to one another
when quests are triggered, text will appear on the hud to give the player a hint on what they must to do complete the quest/event
come up with quests which do not require other ui elements to have the player figure out how to complete the quest
quests should be varied and unique to one another and should always be based on one of the five pillars (exploration, experimentation, combat, strategy, chaos)
