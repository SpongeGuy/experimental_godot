creature ideas for wacky chaotic arcade game
not all creatures have to be hostile per se, just have odd/unique mechanics
this game will look a bit like pac man except there are no teams, just shit happening all around you
the main goal is to survive and get stronger like a roguelike
walls can be destroyed and created as well

i want a theme of emergent gameplay. 
this is an arena style game so i want as much love put into the creatures as possible. 
gameplay ideally should be deep, not wide. 
creature behaviors should ideally interact with other creature behaviors in some way. 
this donâ€™t have to be the case always, but is better if true.

[*] idea
[-] additional information / relevant context


* swarm flea
	- wants to be in and around corners
	- flock style movement and creates swarm mist particles when startled or moving quickly
	- fleas are attracted to kori nests and will eat and scatter fruit from the nests
	- swarm mist reacts explosively with the drill bore's gold but makes it even more valuable
	- if the mist catches on fire (like from the pyre), it expands rapidly in a shockwave, causing damage to everything
	
* jumpy bug
	- jumps long distances, can jump on top of walls
	- stomps enemies, shoots a bullet which goes over walls
	- jumpy bug can stomp on the gnome statue to slam it into walls or creatures at high speed
	- can sometimes abduct other creatures and jump with them
	
* gnome statue
	- does nothing except get pushed around and knocks into things
	- shatters if crashed into anything at high velocity
	- can make itself heavy and immovable for a period of time
	- a magical variety of this guy who can hop around into other creatures
	
* grunt
	- simply pathfinds around randomly but continuously
	- attacks if any creature grows too near, but won't pursue
	
* growl
	- like the grunt but actively searches for fruit and consumes it
	- will think that the false item is fruit if it is disguised as such

* beetoo
	- lays bombs as eggs
	- eggs will detonate instantly if pyre is nearby
	- eggs can be picked up by the magnet mite or the bounce blob

* drill bore
	- drills through walls
	- leaves behind valuable gold which attracts greedy creatures
	- the drill bore can be ambushed by the wall master very easily
	- the kori can mistake gold for fruit and bring it to its nest
	
* kori
	- builds a nest and grows hatchlings
	- runs around grabbing fruit and delivering it to nest
	- sometimes grabs other things besides fruit
	- nest can be destroyed and then the hatchlings will wander
	- if the hatchlings get enough food they will transform into rage beasts
	
* hoary
	- cranky old man
	- sneezes
	- builds a rocking chair
	
* worm
	- multiple body segments
	- can only bite you from its head
	- can only move in four directions
	- severing the worm in half creates two unique worm creatures
	- worm grows longer if it eats fruit
	- explosions may cause the worm to split into many worm heads
	
* cultist
	- summons fireballs to throw at you
	- fireballs ignite swarm mist
	- fireballs are absorbed by bounce blob but cause it to overheat and split
	- fireballs explode walls
	
* glub gob
	- eats as much fruit as possible
	- if it finds a kori nest it will eat the whole thing
	- will tear apart the magnet mite's junk armor
	- when killed, drops everything it consumed at once
	
* beholder
	- shoots a continuous laser beam
	- beam direction is fixed
	- floats around aimlessly
	
* dungeon cube
	- quickly launches itself in one of four directions and stops if it hits a wall
	- anything in its path takes huge damage and is knocked back

* patte
	- similar to grunt
	- clones itself when it's harmed

* pyre
	- is on fire continuously
	- sets ground and creatures nearby on fire
	- has a fire shockwave attack
	- hops around and can jump long distances, has a chance to drop fire below it
	
* poltergeist
	- shuffles terrain around itself including all that is on the tile

* rage beast
	- aggressively pursues and kills other creatures
	- can be pacified by the song moth, transforming into a harmless critter

* transmog
	- transforms fruit into powerups

* song moth
	- flutters and hums melodies that charm nearby creatures
	- creatures will follow in a conga line and join in on the song

* waddler
	- is followed by its children
	- children will scatter if parent is attacked
	- if parent is killed children will become hostile to the killer

* anhurgir
	- spirit who can travel through walls
	- shoots a pellet occasionally
	- can sometimes merge a creature with a wall so it can't move

* cat
	- scratches and runs away
	- naps in corners
	- hunts swarm fleas and causes them to dash away

* bubble blower
	- creates expanding bubbles that trap creatures inside, floating them away until popped
	
* echo bat
	- screams to create sound waves that bounce off walls, stunning anything they hit multiple times
	
* spin wheel
	- travels only in diagonal path non-stop

* puzzle piece
	- locks onto other creatures or walls to form temporary structures
	
* clockwork mouse
	- winds itself up periodically then dashes in straight lines
	
* false item
	- disguises as fruit or powerups but bites when approached and summons teeth minions

* ink blot
	- spreads across the ground like an oil spill, making areas slippery
	- variety which makes creatures and items invisible/hazy
	
* wall master
	- can only travel on the faces of walls except when jumping to another face closeby
	
* flame wheel
	- like in terraria
	
* popcorn kernel
	- if lit on fire bursts into a ton of popped corns which jump and fidget around
	
* portal gremlin
	- drops random portals which link distant parts of the maze
	
* magnet mite
	- attracts loose debris or other creatures toward it, building a growing junk ball of armor

* spikeball
	- rolls around and does big contact damage
	- can be propelled to increase its velocity permanently until it shatters
	- the faster it's going, the more damage it does
	
* slug
	- leaves blocks of slime behind it which block off areas
	
* imp
	- projects fake versions of itself and jumps around
	
* bounce blob
	- absorbs impacts and bounces off of walls, every time it bounces it grows larger until it bursts into tiny slime creatures
	
* whistler
	- causes creatures to temporarily ally or rage against each other
	
* aureate crawler
	- grows crystals on its body
	- crystals reflect lasers or bullets
	- crystals react chaotically to any form of contact damage
		- explosions, teleportation, summoning
	- crystals can break off and land on the ground, where they behave the same

* slushy
	- ice tornado
	- creates ice shards and plants them on the ground
	- freezes the ground so it's slippery
	- makes terrain more brittle
